# 2026 - Git/GitHub Interactive Workshop at Wayne State University

Hello, there!

This is an example of what a README might look like for a given project. Put simply,
this is where you can _concisely_ go over what your project does, why it exists and 
maybe a few install/build/run instructions if applicable. 

You can also include pictures here if your project is visually  appealing 
or if you'd just like to show off your Software.
